   <h2 style="font-family:georgia;"><i>Biography:</i></h2>
    <p stly="font-family:georgia;">I was born in Hayward, CA on March 25th, 2001 and given the name Karen Vanessa Zepeda.
    I was born into a family<br>comprised of four, later growing twice the size to eight members. I have grown up my whole life
    in the Bay Area<br>with my five sisters, parents, and my cat, Nico. I dream of becoming an astrophysicist and love
    to help out with events in<br>my community. My favorite subject is math, I spend an abundance of my time to practice brush lettering, and love to go out<br>and eat with my sisters.</p>

    This is referred to as galaxy cannabalism.</p>

    My partner and I created a side scrolling                          <b>Youtube</b>: I spend the majority of my day simply
    game that follows a hungry character as                             watching random youtube videos. It's usually how I pass the time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Link.</a>
    they race across a dinner table, collecting                         <b>Netflix</b> : Despite the somewhat limited selection of shows
    as many apples as possible, all while avoiding                    I enjoy going on netflix to binge watch tv series that they have available. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Link.</a>
    rotten apples and forks.                                                     <b>Gmail</b> : Checking on my Gmail everyday and finding new emails 
                                                                                                   makes me feel important, so I genuinely enjoy opening up the webpage. <a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/about/">Link.</a>
