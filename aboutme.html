    <p stly="font-family:georgia;">I was born in Hayward, CA on March 25th and given the name Karen Vanessa Zepeda.
    I was born into a family<br>comprised of four, later growing twice the size to eight. I have grown up
    in the Bay Area<br>with my five sisters, parents, and my cat. I strive to become an astrophysicist and love
    to help out with events in<br>my community. My favorite subject is math and love to go out and eat with my sisters.</p>
