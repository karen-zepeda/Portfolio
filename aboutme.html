    <p stly="font-family:georgia;">I was born in Hayward, CA on March 25th and given the name Karen Vanessa Zepeda.
    I was born into a family<br>comprised of four, later growing twice the size to eight. I have grown up
    in the Bay Area<br>with my five sisters, parents, and my cat. I strive to become an astrophysicist and love
    to help out with events in<br>my community. My favorite subject is math and love to go out and eat with my sisters.</p>

    My partner and I created a side-scrolling                  <b>Youtube</b>: I spend the majority of my day simply
    game that follows a hungry character as                     watching random youtube videos. It's usually how I pass the time.
    they race across a dinner table collecting                 <b>Netflix</b> : Despite the somewhat limited selection of shows
    as many apples as possibles, while avoiding                 I enjoy going on netflix to binge watch some of my favorite shows.
    rotten apples and forks.                                   <b>Gmail</b> : Checking on my Gmail everyday and finding new emails 
                                                                makes me feel important, so I enjoy opening up the website.
